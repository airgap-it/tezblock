  Athens A proposes two incremental changes:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Increase the gas limit by doubling the number of computation steps which can be included in each block.</li>
  <li>Reduce roll size from 10,000 ꜩ to 8,000 ꜩ</li>
</ul>

<p>
  The gas limit was set conservatively at launch to protect the chain, with the idea that it could be increased via the amendment process.
  This proposal would increase the gas limit by allowing double the computation steps in each block while keeping the number of IOs
  performed in each block unchanged. This would enable more computation in blocks and operations, meaning that not only the maximum of
  transactions per block could increase, but also the complexity of transactions.
</p>

<p>
  The second is a reduction in the roll size from 10,000 ꜩ to 8,000 ꜩ. In the current Tezos consensus, a baker must have 10,000 ꜩ to be
  randomly selected to propose or endorse a block. In addition to increasing the gas limit, this amendment would reduce that threshold to
  8,000 ꜩ, incrementally lowering the barrier to entry to baking and subsequently, block creation. For more information on Tezos Proof of
