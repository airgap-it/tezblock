<p>
  We are offering the community two versions of the Florence proposal to choose
  between, one with Baking Accounts (as described below) and one without; we’ll
  explain the rationale for this decision later in this blog post.
</p>
<h5>Features</h5>
<p>
  <strong>Increased Maximum Operation Size:</strong>
  Previously, the maximum size of an operation was 16kB. In Florence, we propose
  to increase it to 32kB. Among other things, this has the effect of slightly
  more than doubling the maximum size of a smart contract, which should be of
  interest to some developers with particularly complicated applications.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Gas Optimizations:</strong>
  We have again reduced gas consumption in smart contract execution by
  increasing the efficiency of gas computation inside the Michelson interpreter.
  This allows for smart contracts with more complicated functionality to operate
  economically on the chain. We will continue to work on further efficiency
  improvements in coming versions of the protocol.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Baking Accounts:</strong>
  Previously, token holders delegated to a baker by specifying that baker’s
  public key hash. This meant that bakers could never change their public keys,
  which was exceptionally inconvenient. The new “Baking Accounts” feature
  alleviates this issue. In Florence, a new account type has been added to
  represent accounts managed by bakers. These accounts are Michelson smart
  contracts running a fixed multisig script. This feature lets bakers renew and
  split their consensus keys without moving to a new address and asking their
  delegators to follow. In addition to the usual internal operations, baking
  accounts can also emit baking operations such as proposing and voting for
  protocol amendments.
  <br />
  (The rights granted to the baking key (baking, endorsing, voting, and spending
  the funds) remain unchanged. However, the system also allows a baker to vote
  and access their funds using multisig authentication. Not using the baking key
  for such tasks reduces the risk of it being exposed, and the baking key can
  also be rotated in a worst case scenario.)
  <br />
  Although we strongly believe that Baking Accounts are an important new
  addition to the Tezos protocol, and although we have made considerable effort
  to make them backwards compatible with existing code, we recognize that client
  libraries, wallets, indexers, and other software will require some work to
  fully support Baking Accounts. We are thus providing the community with the
  opportunity to decide for itself during the Proposal Period whether or not to
  include this feature in the Florence update.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Depth First Execution Order:</strong>
  Previously, intercontract calls were executed in a so-called “breadth first”
  ordering. This was believed to be the correct choice when the Tezos protocol
  was initially designed, but it has turned out to significantly complicate the
  lives of smart contract developers. If Florence is adopted, the calling
  convention will change to a “depth first” execution order. This will make it
  far easier to reason about intercontract calls.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>No More Test Chain:</strong>
  Previously, during the voting process, a test chain would be spun up during
  the “testing period” which took place between the exploration and promotion
  voting periods. The intent was that this test chain be used to assure that the
  new proposal worked correctly, but in practice, the test chain has never been
  used in this manner, and has caused significant operational problems to node
  operators. The new proposal eliminates the test chain activation; the testing
  period has been retained but is now named the “cooldown period”. Instead, we
  will continue to test the protocol using test chains that operate outside of
  the mainnet voting process.

<h5>Invoice</h5>
<p>
  This protocol amendment and the related updates to the Tezos shell were
  developed by programmers from Nomadic Labs, Metastate, DaiLambda, Marigold,
  Tarides, and an external contributor, Keefer Taylor 16, to whom the proposals
  grant an invoice of ꜩ100 to thank him for his merge request that increased the
  maximum operation size.
