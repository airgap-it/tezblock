<h5>Features</h5>
<p>
  The Carthage proposal, a joint effort from Nomadic Labs and Cryptium Labs, is referred to as a housekeeping proposal as it focuses on code
  cleanup, adding optimizations, and fixing small issues rather than adding significant new features. The only novelty is an increase in the
  gas limit which will allow executing more complex smart contracts:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>The gas limit per operation was increased from 800,000 to 1,040,000</li>
  <li>The gas limit per block was increased from 8,000,000 to 10,400,000</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Another relevant change is that the formula used for calculating baking and endorsing rewards was improved in order to provide more
  accurate results:
</p>

<p>
  The baking reward formula was changed to make it linear in the number of endorsements included instead of a step function. The formula was
  further modified in order to make it more resistant to certain types of attacks.
</p>

<p>Carthage also contains several minor improvements to Michelson.</p>
