<h5>Features</h5>
<p>
  The Carthage proposal, a joint effort from Nomadic Labs and Cryptium Labs, is
  referred to as a housekeeping proposal as it focuses on code cleanup, adding
  optimizations, and fixing small issues rather than adding significant new
  features. The only novelty is an increase in the gas limit which will allow
  executing more complex smart contracts:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>The gas limit per operation was increased from 800,000 to 1,040,000</li>
  <li>The gas limit per block was increased from 8,000,000 to 10,400,000</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Another relevant change is that the formula used for calculating baking and
  endorsing rewards was improved in order to provide more accurate results:
</p>

<p>
  The baking reward formula was changed to make it linear in the number of
  endorsements included instead of a step function. The formula was further
  modified in order to make it more resistant to certain types of attacks.
