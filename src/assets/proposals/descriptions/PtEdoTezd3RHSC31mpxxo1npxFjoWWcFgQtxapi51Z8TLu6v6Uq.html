<p>
  Adds two major features: Sapling and BLS12-381 to enable privacy-preserving
  smart contracts and tickets for native permissions. Updates amendment process
  by lowering period length to 5 cycles and adding a 5th Adoption Period. Also
  includes minor Michelson improvements.

<h5>Features</h5>

<p>
  The Edo proposal, a joint effort from Nomadic Labs, Marigold, and Metastate is
  a protocol upgrade proposal focused on implementing new features such as
  Sapling and Tickets, and adding core functionality improvements to the Tezos
  protocol.
</p>

    >Sapling</a
  >
  , originally developed by the Electric Coin Company, will be integrated to
  enable privacy-preserving transactions on Tezos. With recent improvements, the
  time needed for crafting and verifying transactions using Sapling have reached
  practical levels suitable for any end-user. Coupled with this is the addition
  of Michelson opcodes for the pairing-friendly elliptic curve BLS12-381.
</p>

<p>
  Tickets provide a mechanism for smart-contract to grant portable permissions
  to other smart-contracts, or to issue tokens. This enables new kinds of
  composable contract architectures and aims to guard against common smart
  contract vulnerabilities.
</p>

<p>
  Edo also adds several new instructions to Michelson, including LEVEL, which
  has been widely requested by developers exploring Layer-2 scaling solutions.
</p>

<p>New instructions</p>

<ul>
  <li>New hash functions: instructions KECCAK and SHA3</li>
  <li>Instruction LEVEL to query the level of the current block</li>
  <li>
    Instructions VOTING_POWER (and resp. TOTAL_VOTING_POWER) to query the voting
    power of a particular delegate (resp. of all delegates)
  </li>
  <li>
    Instruction SELF_ADDRESS equivalent to SELF; ADDRESS but allowed in lambdas
  </li>
</ul>

<h5>Amendment Process Updates</h5>

<p>
  A new fifth period called “Adoption” is a means to improve governance on Tezos
  by providing an additional window for bakers, indexers, and end-users to
  upgrade their nodes once a protocol upgrade goes live. At the moment, protocol
  upgrades that pass go live one block after the completion of voting has been
  perceived to provide an insufficient update window. This Adoption period aims
  to provide a more suitable time window for these updates.
</p>
<p>
  Additionally, amendment period lengths will be reduced from 8 cycles to 5
  cycles, making the total duration of the voting procedure 25 cycles (~2 months
  and 10 days).
