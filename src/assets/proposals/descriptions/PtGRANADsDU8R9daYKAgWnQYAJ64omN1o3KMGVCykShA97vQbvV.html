  Granada contains several major improvements to the protocol, as well as numerous bug fixes and minor improvements. Below we discuss some
  of the most interesting and important changes:
</p>
<h5>Features</h5>
<p>
  <strong>Emmy*:</strong>
  The current Tezos consensus algorithm is Emmy+ and we propose to replace it with Emmy*. As described
  <a href="https://blog.nomadic-labs.com/faster-finality-with-emmy.html" target="_blank">this blog post</a>
  , if Granada is adopted, Emmy* will generally halve the time between blocks, from 60 seconds to 30 seconds, and allow transactions to
  achieve significantly faster finality than under the current consensus algorithm. (We expect several significant further improvements to
  our consensus algorithm and reductions in block times in coming proposals.)
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Liquidity Baking:</strong>
  The availability of low-slippage exchange of tez into other currencies and vice-versa is key to allow the widespread use of Tezos.
  <a href="https://gitlab.com/tzip/tzip/-/blob/master/drafts/current/draft-liquidity_baking.md" target="_blank">Liquidity Baking</a>
  addresses this directly by piggybacking off the liquidity and global availability of Bitcoin, and incentivizing large amounts of
  decentralized liquidity provision between tez and wrapped bitcoins.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Gas improvements:</strong>
  A number of substantial improvements to performance have been made, which in turn result in dramatic reductions in gas consumption. We
  have generally observed a decrease of a factor of three to six in the gas consumed in the execution of already deployed contracts. For
  some contracts, the improvement has been almost a factor of eight. This reduction in gas consumption, the latest in a series we began with
  Delphi, will enable developers to deploy richer, more complicated, and more interesting applications on Tezos at reasonable real-world
  cost.
