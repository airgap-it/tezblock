  Ithaca contains two major updates to the protocol, as well as numerous minor
  improvements. Below we discuss some of the most interesting and important
  changes.

<h5>Tenderbake</h5>
<p>
  Tenderbake is a major update to the Tezos consensus algorithm. Like
  Tendermint, Tenderbake brings fast deterministic finality to the Tezos
  protocol.
</p>
<p>Tenderbake comes with a set of important changes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    The protocol moves away from a roll-based model to an optimized stake-based
    model to allocate rewards: bakers will receive rewards depending on their
    current stake instead of the number of rolls they own.
  </li>
  <li>
    A reduction in the minimal number of tokens required to be selected as a
    validator would be implemented: from 8,000 tez to 6,000 tez. This minimal
    stake of 6,000 tez remains necessary for performance reasons.
  </li>
  <li>
    The baking and endorsement rewards mechanism has been reworked (c.f. rewards
    documentation). In particular, baking rewards will be credited
    instantaneously, and not frozen for 5 cycles as is the case with Emmy*.
    Furthermore, there will no longer be a variance for endorsement rewards. The
    total sum of endorsement rewards for a cycle will be fully distributed at
    the end of the same cycle, provided delegates have at least 2/3 of their
    endorsement slots included in blocks.
  </li>
  <li>
    A new security deposit mechanism is introduced: delegates are required to
    freeze, at minimum, 10% of their stake in advance in order to obtain baking
    and endorsement rights. A new operation Set_deposit_limit is also introduced
    to manually manage this limit.
  </li>
  <li>
    The number of endorsement slots per block has been bumped from 256 to 7,000:
    this means that a delegate with the minimum amount of tokens will
    participate every 10 blocks on average. The node’s storage layer and
    prevalidator have been optimized to handle the charge, with the precheck
    feature also contributing to the increase in performance. The number of
    endorsement operations, which will continue to endorse multiple slots, will
    be proportional to the number of validators in the network, i.e. around 500.
  </li>
  <li>
    Since Tenderbake is modeled after classical BFT consensus algorithms, it
    favors safety over liveness and requires active participation of validators
    holding 2/3 of the stake in order for the chain to progress.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  This consensus algorithm also offers the possibility to easily reduce the
  minimal time between blocks, which may be proposed in future Tezos protocol
  amendments.
</p>

<h5>Precheck of operations</h5>
<p>
  The new version of the protocol will enable the prechecking of operations.
  This is not a feature of the Ithaca protocol proposal per se, but it rather
  consists of a new set of functions which are exposed by the economic protocol,
  and which can be used by any Tezos shell (e.g., Octez and TezEdge) to avoid
  fully executing manager operations before gossiping them through the network.
</p>
<p>
  The feature serves mainly one purpose: increasing the number of operations
  gossiped over the Tezos network. It is a prequel to further optimizations that
  should increase the transaction throughput over the Tezos network.
</p>

<h5>Liquidity Baking</h5>
<p>
  Ithaca includes an increase to the liquidity baking sunset level of 819,200
  blocks, or twenty voting periods, roughly an additional ten months. This
  bigger increase will avoid needing to worry about the sunset level for the
  next few protocol amendments. Also, to balance this increase, the threshold
  for activating the escape hatch is lowered from 50% to 33%.
