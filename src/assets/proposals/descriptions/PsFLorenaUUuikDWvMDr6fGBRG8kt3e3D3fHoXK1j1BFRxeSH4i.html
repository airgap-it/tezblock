  We are offering the community two versions of the Florence proposal to choose
  between, one with Baking Accounts (as described below) and one without; we’ll
  explain the rationale for this decision later in this blog post.
</p>
<h5>Features</h5>
<p>
  <strong>Increased Maximum Operation Size:</strong>
  Previously, the maximum size of an operation was 16kB. In Florence, we propose
  to increase it to 32kB. Among other things, this has the effect of slightly
  more than doubling the maximum size of a smart contract, which should be of
  interest to some developers with particularly complicated applications.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Gas Optimizations:</strong>
  We have again reduced gas consumption in smart contract execution by
  increasing the efficiency of gas computation inside the Michelson interpreter.
  This allows for smart contracts with more complicated functionality to operate
  economically on the chain. We will continue to work on further efficiency
  improvements in coming versions of the protocol.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Depth First Execution Order:</strong>
  Previously, intercontract calls were executed in a so-called “breadth first”
  ordering. This was believed to be the correct choice when the Tezos protocol
  was initially designed, but it has turned out to significantly complicate the
  lives of smart contract developers. If Florence is adopted, the calling
  convention will change to a “depth first” execution order. This will make it
  far easier to reason about intercontract calls.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>No More Test Chain:</strong>
  Previously, during the voting process, a test chain would be spun up during
  the “testing period” which took place between the exploration and promotion
  voting periods. The intent was that this test chain be used to assure that the
  new proposal worked correctly, but in practice, the test chain has never been
  used in this manner, and has caused significant operational problems to node
  operators. The new proposal eliminates the test chain activation; the testing
  period has been retained but is now named the “cooldown period”. Instead, we
  will continue to test the protocol using test chains that operate outside of
  the mainnet voting process.

<h5>Invoice</h5>
<p>
  This protocol amendment and the related updates to the Tezos shell were
  developed by programmers from Nomadic Labs, Metastate, DaiLambda, Marigold,
  Tarides, and an external contributor, Keefer Taylor 16, to whom the proposals
  grant an invoice of ꜩ100 to thank him for his merge request that increased the
  maximum operation size.
