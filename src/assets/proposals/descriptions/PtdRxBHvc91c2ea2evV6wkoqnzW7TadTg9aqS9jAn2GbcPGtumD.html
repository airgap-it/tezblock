<h5>Features</h5>
<p>Brest A offers two changes.</p>
<p>
  The first aims to patch a security issue pertaining to the rehashing performed
  during the Athens protocol change, given it was not enough to prevent some
  kinds of attacks. This amendment performs a new rehashing that makes these
  attacks ineffective. The path length of addresses is increased from 7 to 9,
  making the attack 65536 times more difficult.
</p>

<p>
  The second aims to make amendment invoice tracking easier. The way amendment
  invoices were done in the Athens protocol made it difficult to track for
  external tools, as no balance updates were generated for these invoices. As a
  consequence, a block explorer could not detect the changes, and the changes
  had to be added manually. This proposal will enable the changes to be included
  as balance updates in the first block of the new protocol.
