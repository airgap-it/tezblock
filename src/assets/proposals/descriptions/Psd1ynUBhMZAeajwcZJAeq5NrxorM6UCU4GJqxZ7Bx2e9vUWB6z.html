<h5>Features</h5>
<p>Athens B proposes one incremental change:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Increase the gas limit by doubling the number of computation steps which can
    be included in each block.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  The gas limit was set conservatively at launch to protect the chain, with the
  idea that it could be increased via the amendment process. This proposal would
  increase the gas limit by allowing double the computation steps in each block
  while keeping the number of IOs performed in each block unchanged. This would
  enable more computation in blocks and operations, meaning that not only the
  maximum of transactions per block could increase, but also the complexity of
  transactions.
</p>

<p>
  Please note that beyond this incremental change, the upgrade proposal also
  includes minor fixes which do not significantly change the protocol, as
  described in the
